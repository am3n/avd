# avd
Legacy &amp; very simple! android emulator manager

The emulator has been having problems with newer versions of the studio for me, so I decided to use the older version until these bugs are resolved.


# Install
1- Add your <../Sdk/emulator/> path to environments

2- Put avd.sh file in the desired directory or <../Sdk/>

3- Add your desired dir or <../Sdk/> path to environments


# Run
1- open terminal & type <avd.sh> & hit enter

2- type index number of your emulator & hit enter
